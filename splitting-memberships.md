# Splitting and Combining memberships

These are all scenarios that have popped up in the last 4-5 years.  They have all been handled differently and usually addressed with a combination of a new application for membership and sometimes manual changes in the database.

The names have not been changed because it was easier that way. :)

They are all edge cases and stretch goals.  I just thought of this this morning (November 9th 2021).

# Aging out
Sean is on his dad Randy’s membership.  But then Sean graduates college, and is no longer able to ride on his dad’s membership.  So he has to have his own.

Randy retains existing membership under his name. 

Sean is a new member with a new start date and new points history.  
       
# Splitting households  
Mike is a member and his wife Cathy is on his membership. But then they separate.

Their two kids, Debbie and Mark, can go to either membership as long as one parent is a member.

Mike retains the existing membership under his name.

Cathy is a new member with a new start date and new points history.

# Combining households

In 2018, Chris was a member and Stefanie was a member.  They met at the track and now live together. They would like to combine their membership.

Stefanie's son, Damien, age 12, is on her membership.  He would be a family member on a combined membership.

This one is tricky because both have a points history with significant amounts of work.  To this point we have not combined their membership.  I advised them not to for other reasons.  If they pushed the issue I would have to figure it out.

One way to do this would be to merge the work history into one membership.  But this would be for historical purposes only.  

We could combine the membership and use the oldest membership date (Chris in this case) as their start date.  Then list one as the primary, and the others (including all kids) as family members on the membership.
